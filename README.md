## What is this?

1. REST API for managing farm inventory via HTTP requests
2. Web application for managing farming inventory

The inventory service enables users to keep track of farm inventory across multiple IoT devices, servers, applications, or databases. This service provides a foundational interface for inventory management and interaction.
